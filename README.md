# Lord of the Rings Memory Game
A Test of Working Memory - Random Order Unique Image Selection.

## The Task 
The task was to develop a web application using the React JavaScript library to build a user interface for a clicky game. A listing of the web technologies employed is provided in the **Tech Employed** section below.

## Site Overview 

<div align="center">
    <img src="/public/images/lor_click_game.png" width="400px" /></img> 
</div>
<br>
This single page site presents the user an with concise instructions and easy to use interface. For each unique picture the user selects, she/he earns a point. The tricky part is that the pictures are shuffled in random order after each image click. The user continues to earn points until she/he selects an image that has already been selected. When any image is selected more than once, the game resets the score to zero and the user can try again. The highest score achieved is also tracked and displayed just to the right of the current score for a given round.
